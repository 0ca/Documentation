# Operational Pieces

This section will highlight a few of the pieces of Mythic that operators are most likely to use on a daily basis.

* [Browser Scripts](browser-scripts.md) - use JavaScript to transform your command output into tables, buttons, links, and more
* [Active Callbacks](active-callbacks.md) - the main operational page for interacting with callbacks, also allows you to see graph/tree views of your callbacks
* [Files](files.md) - view the uploads and downloads for the operation
* [Search](search.md) - search commands, command parameters, and command output across the operation&#x20;
* [Credentials](credentials.md) - view/comment/edit/add credentials for your operation
* Expanded[ Callbacks](split-callbacks.md) - this allows you to view callbacks as the full screen so that you have more operational screen space
* [Screencaptures](screenshots.md) - all of the screencaptures throughout the operation can be viewed and downloaded here
* [Event Feed](event-feed.md) - view all of the events going on throughout an operation (new payloads, new callbacks, users signing in, etc) as well as a basic chat program to send messages to all operators in the operation
