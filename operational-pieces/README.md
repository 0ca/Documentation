# Operational Pieces

This section will highlight a few of the pieces of Mythic that operators are most likely to use on a daily basis.

* [Analytics](analytics.md) - some higher-level analytics and information about the entire operation
* [Browser Scripts](browser-scripts.md) - use JavaScript to transform your command output into tables, buttons, links, and more
* [Active Callbacks](active-callbacks.md) - the main operational page for interacting with callbacks, also allows you to see graph/tree views of your callbacks
* [Files](files.md) - view the uploads and downloads for the operation
* [Search](search.md) - search commands, command parameters, and command output across the operation via regex
* [Credentials](credentials.md) - view/comment/edit/add credentials for your operation
* [Comments](comments.md) - view and search all comments across the operation
* [All Callbacks](all-callbacks.md) - view all callbacks in an operation (active and inactive). You can also move inactive callbacks _back_ to the [Active Callbacks](active-callbacks.md) screen from here so that you can task them again
* [Split Callbacks](split-callbacks.md) - this allows you to view callbacks side-by-side or as the full screen so that you have more operational screen space
* [Screencaptures](screenshots.md) - all of the screencaptures throughout the operation can be viewed and downloaded here
* [Event Feed](event-feed.md) - view all of the events going on throughout an operation (new payloads, new callbacks, users signing in, etc) as well as a basic chat program to send messages to all operators in the operation
* [Task Feed](task-feed.md) - view the last 200 tasks issued in the operation across all callbacks to provide a better operational lead awareness
