# Analytics

### What are they?

Analytics are a way to get a broader view of the operation based on the data that Mythic collects automatically.

### Where are they?

Analytics are located at the "Operational Views" -> "Analytics Dashboard" page from the top navigation bar. Anybody in the operation can view these analytics.

### Why provide them?

During an operation, it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. These basic analytics start to provide some context to how an operation is going overall, what kind of footprint was left on the target network, what commands do operators use most frequently, which target hosts had the most activity, and more. These are pretty basic for the moment, but will build out over time into cleaner dashboards.
