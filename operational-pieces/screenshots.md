# Screenshots

## Where is it?

Screenshots for an entire operation can be accessed via the "Operational Views" -> "Screenshots" page from the top navigational bar.

## How to use it?

Screenshots are listed in tasking order.

To view a screenshot, simply select the eye icon to view the image in a new overlay. To download the image, click the download icon. If a screenshot is still downloading, you'll see the progress so far under the `Completed` column. Since these are images, you can view them as they come in even if they're not finished being sent to the server yet (you'll just see a portion of the image).

Screenshots can also be viewed within the main active callbacks window as well. Select the dropdown for a callback and select "screenshots"

The same interaction method applies here as well - click the row and the screenshot will be displayed in-line.&#x20;
