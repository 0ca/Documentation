# MythicRPC

## What is MythicRPC

MythicRPC provides a way to execution functions against Mythic and Mythic's database programmatically from within your command's Python tasking files.

## Where is MythicRPC

MythicRPC lives as part of the `mythic_payloadtype_container` PyPi package that's included in all of the `itsafeaturemythic` Docker images. This PyPi package uses rabbitmq's RPC functionality to execute functions that exist within Mythic.&#x20;

For a full list of these functions and calling examples, check out the [RPC](../../updating/mythic-2.1-greater-than-2.2-updates/agents-2.1.-greater-than-2.2.2/mythicrpc.md) page.
